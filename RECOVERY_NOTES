LinuxBIOS is the wrong thing? I guess I started that and then realized I needed the i82801 support? 

In any event for now that's what I'm running with.

OK, leaving all smm enablement in coreboot, but NOT locking the smm ram, seems to allow me to
get to the 0x38000 infinite loop in linux arch/x86/realmode/rm/smmhandler.S
